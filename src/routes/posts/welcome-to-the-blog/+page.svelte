	<p>Hello, and welcome to the blog! I'll start by introducing myself:</p>
	<p>
		My name is Ian Thompson, and I am currently a senior elementary education major at Clemson
		University. I know what you're thinking: why does an elementary education major have a tech
		blog? And that is such a valid question to ask yourself...
	</p>

				It all started when I was in middle school. I began to develop a deep interest in computers
				and programming. I started out learning the Objective-C language, and by the time I was in
				8th grade, I published my first application to the Apple App Store (of course, under my
				mom's name since you had to be 18 with a valid driver's license to publish!). From there, I
				went on to learn Swift, and by 10th grade, I published my second game to the App Store.
			</p>
			<p>
				Throughout middle and high school, I devoted much of my free time to learning different
				programing languages and technologies. My first formal programming class was in 10th grade
				in a beginner Python introduction course my high school offered. From there, I would go on
				to take AP Computer Science A in the 11th grade, all while working on various personal
				coding projects, many of which have never seen the light of day.

		This deep interest and apparent skill in computer science would lead me to believe that I would
		go on to major in CS in college. Well, the Lord had different plans...

				In 2019, I applied and got accepted to Clemson University as a computer engineering major.
				However, almost immediately after being accepted, I switched programs to elementary
				education. Teaching and sharing my knowledge have always interested me. So much so, while a
				middle and high schooler, I would frequently make programming tutorials on my YouTube
				channel. (I'm sure a few of these still exist somewhere on the internet). In my senior year
				of high school, I took a job at my old elementary school, working in the extended day
				program. There, I felt a call from the Lord to switch majors and pursue a degree in
				education.
			</p>

			<p>
				At the time, Clemson did not offer a middle-level education program, and to be honest, if
				you had asked me if I ever saw myself in the middle school classroom, I would have
				immediately told you "no." But, as is a running theme in my life, and at the risk of
				sounding overly clich√®, the Lord works in mysterious ways. While in college, I began
				volunteering for Young Life as a WyldLife leader, a ministry set on bringing the Gospel to
				middle school-aged students. Here I found the deep love for the middle school grades the
				Lord has instilled in me. While I wish I would have switched to the middle-level major
				sooner, a major switch would be too much of a hassle at this point in my undergraduate
				career. As such, I am sticking with the elementary major but hope to find a 6th-grade
				position upon graduation and plan to certify in middle-level math and science as soon as
				possible.

		That still doesn't answer the purpose of this blog. Here, I hope to keep record of the various
		projects that I work on and to archive the different things that interest me. I make no aim to
		"get famous" or to contribute novel ideas to the universe. I want a place to publically gather
		and display my ideas, thoughts, and accomplishments with whoever may see them. This site is a
		work in progress. You will likely see things that don't look right and experience bugs. Just
		think of it as a way enjoy the imperfection of human nature.
