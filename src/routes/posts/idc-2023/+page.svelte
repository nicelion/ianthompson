		This past June, I had the privilege of traveling to Chicago to visit the Association for
		Computing Machinery <External src="https://idc.acm.org/2023/"
			>Interaction Design & Children Conference</External
		>. At this conference, I had the honor of representing the <External
			src="https://idealab.sites.clemson.edu/">IDEA Lab @ Clemson University</External> and present our
		work in progress education application entitled S.P.O.T: Solving Problems of Tomorrow.
	</p>
	<Section title="About S.P.O.T">
		<p>
			S.P.O.T is a project I have contributed to during my time as an undergraduate research
			assistant with the IDEA Lab @ Clemson University. S.P.O.T is a web based application written
			in Svelte and TypeScript that introduces young learners to artificial intelligence. Through
			S.P.O.T, children are able to examine AI's use and applications in a sociopolitical context
			and are empowered become critical examiners of its use.

					While at the conference, I had the honor of presenting our work during a Works-in-Progress
					lightning round and during a poster session. Here, I interacted with many professors,
					students, and industry leaders in child-computer-interaction and AI-interaction.
