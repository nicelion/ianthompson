                    I am very eager to begin my career upon my graduation in May of 2024! Though my graduation is a little over a year away, I am still interested in working with you! I am open to internships and freelancing. You can find more information below:

                    <p>
                        Upon my May 2024 graduation, I will be looking for a teaching position in the Anderson/Greenville area. I will be certified in grades 2-6th, but hoping to teach grades 4th-6th.

                    <h2 class="text-xl underline">Internships</h2>
                    <p>
                        Do you have or know of an internship in a field I might be interested in? I currently have no commitments for Summer 2024. I am interested in research based internships, specifically in the fields listed <a class="url" href="/#about">here</a>, however I am open to other fields as well!
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl underline">Freelancing</h2>
                    <p>
                        Do you have an idea for a website or app that you would like to get developed? I am interested! I also run a small business, <a class="url" href="https://www.nicelion.com">Nice Lion Technologies, LLC</a> which I freelance through. Please navigate to the website linked to reach out with business inquires.

                    <p>
                        I'll be honest, I do not like the term <span class="italic">consulting.</span> I do not feel as though I am experienced enough to <span class="italic">consult.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, if you have a question or need help with something and you think I might be able to provide insight, I would love to chat!

            <p class="mb-5">
                If I have piqued your interest, please do not hesitate to reach out! Below are two emails in which you use to reach out to me. I will also have my socials listed, but those are not my preferred form of communication as my use of social media is very inconsistent. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I realize you may be able to find my phone number online rather easily. However, I ask that we stick to emails first before we move to phone calls. Plus, I ignore any number I do not have saved (thanks robots!).
