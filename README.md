This is the official repository for [iancthompson.dev](https://www.iancthompson.dev).

Please take inspiration for your own website and use in accordance to the provided License.

Note that I am not maintaining this repository with the intent on making this "reusable," in the sense that I am building this for my own personal use but making the source available to you for free. You will need go in and change images/colors/content/whatever to fit your own needs. This is not a skeleton project. Do with that as you will...

## Contributing

If you see an issue in the live version and would like to make a fix, submit a pull request!

## License

Please see LICENSE.md for more information.

Here are a few things to consider (inspired by [Ko](https://github.com/amyjko/faculty)):

- I view the code as public domain. Do what you like with it.
- The site isn't written for reuse, so I recommend forking.
- I'm not in a position to provide a ton of support for adapting it, but I'm happy to answer the occasional question.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
